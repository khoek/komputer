These are files (mainly programs) to help build a computer out of (relatively elementary) ICs.

There is a companion repository [khoek/kcpu-vm](https://github.com/khoek/kcpu-vm) which contains an assembler and hardware-simulating virtual machine for the architecture.

## Contents

- `circuits` - Designs for the various computer modules
- `embedded/tests` - Tests for the various modules
- `tools/eeagle` and `embedded/eeagle` - An EEPROM programmer client--server pair to talk to an Adafruit Metro Mini.
